### About

This page will tell you a little about me, as well as some of the books or games 
I'm experiencing right now.<br />

### About Me
My name is Reece Cullen, and I'm a DIGIT major at Penn State Behrend! (DIGIT is short for Digital Media, Arts, and Technology)<br />
I'd love to be in the game development field, but I've grown to love editing videos during my time at Behrend as well!<br />
In my free time, I love to play video games, draw, and read books! I'm a big fan of horror and fantasy novels.<br />
My favorite games to play with friends are Overwatch 2 and Dead By Daylight, but I'm normally a story-based game enjoyer.<br />

#### Currently Reading: A Game of Thrones (A Dance of Dragons, Book 5)
The cliffhanger at the end of the last
book was pretty gut-wrenching, and having the knowledge I have now, that being<br />
George R.R. Martin refusing to finish his series, it makes it even more painful,<br />
but I'm still incredibly invested in the plights of Westeros. I thought that<br />
book 4's approach was very exciting, including chapters led by characters that<br />
had been side characters before, and book 5 is more of a return to<br />
form, kind of posthumously making book 4 a Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2 situation. And<br />
if you don't understand that reference, go watch Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2!<br /><br />

#### Currently Watching: One Piece
One Piece has some of the best world-building I've ever seen in<br />
such an elongated series, but it's kind of hard to watch sometimes. The pacing<br />
in the anime is very difficult to get through! It would definitely be more<br />
enjoyable to watch weekly if you were caught up with the story. I feel like One Piece<br />
is definitely more enjoyable if
you're involved with the fandom/community. So much of what I see people<br />
online enjoy about the series is fanart of one of the Straw Hats or talking<br />
about the crazy new development in the latest chapter. But as a semi-casual<br />
fan, it's kind of irritating, since nothing in the series has really been a<br />
surprise to me.<br /><br />
