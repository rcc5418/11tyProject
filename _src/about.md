### About

This page will tell you a little about me, as well as some of the books or games 
I'm experiencing right now.<br />

### About Me
My name is Reece Cullen, and I'm a DIGIT major at Penn State Behrend! (DIGIT is short for Digital Media, Arts, and Technology)<br />
I'd love to be in the game development field, but I've grown to love editing videos during my time at Behrend as well!<br />
In my free time, I love to play video games, draw, and read books! I'm a big fan of horror and fantasy novels.<br />
My favorite games to play with friends are Overwatch 2 and Dead By Daylight, but I'm normally a story-based game enjoyer.<br />
My family has a ton of cats. Too many, honestly, but they're cool.

### Currently Reading: A Game of Thrones (A Dance of Dragons, Book 5)

                        id="READToggle" /> Show spoilers<br />The cliffhanger at the end of the last
                    book was pretty gut-wrenching, <span class="readSpoiler">I mean seriously, is
                        Brienne okay???,</span> and having the knowledge I have now, that being
                    George R.R. Martin refusing to finish his series, it makes it even more painful,
                    but I'm still incredibly invested in the plights of Westeros. I thought that
                    book 4's approach was very exciting, including chapters led by characters that
                    had been side characters before <span class="readSpoiler">(Obviously, Brienne
                        sort of became my favorite character in the series for this very reason,
                        Cersei was fun to read as well)</span>, and book 5 is more of a return to
                    form, kind of posthumously making book 4 a Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2 situation. And
                    if you don't understand that reference, go watch Lion King 1 &amp; 1/2!<br />

### Currently Watching: One Piece

<input type="checkbox" id="WATCHToggle" /> Show
                    spoilers<br /> One Piece has some of the best world-building I've ever seen in
                    such an elongated series, but it's kind of hard to watch sometimes. The pacing
                    in the anime is very difficult to get through! It would definitely be more
                    enjoyable to watch weekly if you were caught up with the story. <br /><span
                        class="watchSpoiler">I feel like One Piece is definitely more enjoyable if
                        you're involved with the fandom/community. So much of what I see people
                        online enjoy about the series is fanart of one of the Straw Hats or talking
                        about the crazy new development in the latest chapter. But as a semi-casual
                        fan, it's kind of irritating, since nothing in the series has really been a
                        surprise to me. I knew about Robin's entire introduction arc, as well as all
                        the characters who would go on to join the Straw Hat crew like Franky and
                        Jinbei. For large stuff like that I understand not tiptoeing around, but I
                        feel like I constantly see clips/screenshots of the newest episode/chapter
                        that I would just enjoy more if I saw naturally. Perhaps it is all the
                        internet's fault...</span></p>

### Currently Playing: Mouthwashing
<section class="flexContainer">

                    spoilers<br /> 
This one is kind of cheating, since this isn't a game I'm currently playing, but one I just played!
Mouthwashing is a sci-fi-esque psychological horror about a small group of space-freighters who have 
to survive after their ship is completely stranded in space. What I really like about the game, apart from how 
much it genuinely scared me, which I was not expecting, is it's character-based drama. All the characters
 are unique and interesting, and seeing how they interact leads to some heart-pounding moments. I have some gripes 
about it, sure, but overall, I highly recommend for anyone looking for a short horror game to dive into!
<span class="playSpoiler">Genuinely though, I found every character other than Jimmy to be way more interesting. I don't like Jimmy at all, he's awful. I mean, that's the point, I gather, I'm just not a huge fan of when games make you play as the worst person imaginable.</span>
