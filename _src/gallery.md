## Silvauria: Warrior Princess
In the Fall of 2024, I led a development team to create a game in RPG Maker XP in just a couple months.
It's still under progress, and the development cycle is unforgiving at times, but it's been lots of fun!

It's my job to implement all of the assets, as well as write the game, but I create some assets myself as well!

I designed the games primary antagonist, the **Obsidian King**. To fit into the games themes, we wanted him to have crow-like details. That's why he has those claw-like limbs and that beak-like maw.
