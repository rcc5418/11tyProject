## Silvauria: Warrior Princess
In the Fall of 2024, I led a development team to create a game in RPG Maker XP in just a couple months.
It's still under progress, and the development cycle is unforgiving at times, but it's been lots of fun!<br/>
It's my job to implement all of the assets, as well as write the game, but I create some assets myself as well!
I designed the games primary antagonist, the **Obsidian King**. To fit into the games themes, we wanted him to have crow-like details. That's why he has those claw-like limbs and that beak-like maw.

One thing that I actually quite like to do is to mess around with 3D shapes in Adobe
                Illustrator. <br />I'm a big fan of how the final image looks, it's an almost
                nostalgic style to me.

My favorite part of making videos might just be making the thumbnails. <br />It's
really fun to try to entice the imaginary viewer with hints of what the video
holds.

One of my favorite hobbies that I regretably don't dedicate much time to is making
music. <br />I like to make video game-esque music using the online software at <a href="https://www.bandlab.com" target="_blank">Bandlab.com</a> or <a
href="https://www.soundtrap.com/" target="_blank">Soundtrap.com</a>

I'm also the composer for **Silvauria: Warrior Princess**, writing all the game's music and handling its sound design. Here's some samples from the soundtrack:

**Greed as Black as Coal**, the Obsidian King's theme: <br/>
