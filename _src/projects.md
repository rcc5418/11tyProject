## Projects
This is the page where I'll post all the stuff I've worked on that I'm particularly
proud of. Either for work, or for school!

## Personal Youtube Channel
Since I started using the Adobe products for school, I've loved making videos in
Premiere. So for the last couple years I've been making video essays about whatever
topic I'm fixated on at the moment. Some of them have even drummed up some actual
viewership numbers. Scary, but exciting!<br /> All this to say: <a

## Ace Attorney Project
In Spring 2024, I worked with some peers to catalogue and analyze all the text data
from the Ace Attorney franchise, using data analysis methods we learned in class!<br />

website we created</a>, or alternatively, <a

Here's a little sample of the hijinks we got up to in this project:

Hedgehog comic books, using text analysis methods we learned in class!<br />

## Slime Quest
In Spring 2023, I created a short RPG in the Unreal engine for my game development
class. Here's a youtube video showing off some of the mechanics and creative
decisions:

## WE HAVE A PROBLEM
In Fall 2022, I worked with a group of classmates to create a text-based sci-fi
horror game. I was the coder! <a

here</a>:

Alternatively, <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12xllp7feMpRXeWWBxUoH9V5yfeAbOKmT/view?usp=sharing">
download the game yourself</a> and play it offline:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/12xllp7feMpRXeWWBxUoH9V5yfeAbOKmT/view?usp=sharing<br />
To install and run this game, download the zip file WEHAVEAPROBLEM.zip, uncompress
it to the location of your choice, then open the file and choose either game.html,
game NO FLICKER.html to play without the flickering effect, or game NO CRT.html to
play without the CRT effect entirely.

## Sound Design in Video Games (Video Essay)
An extensive video project detailing numerous details about how the sound in a video
game can enhance the player's performance.<br />Created as part of my Digital Audio
Honors Option course in Spring 2022.

This is a fun one! In my senior year of high school, my computer science's final
project involved making a program of my choice, so I made a tiny game!
