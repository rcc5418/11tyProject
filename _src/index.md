### Hello!

My name is Reece, a DIGIT student looking to work in game design/development. My
hobbies include reading, video games, and making videos. On this site, I'll post
some of the stuff I've made/worked on!
There'll be a lot of different stuff on here, this site is made up of these pages:
<ul>
<li><a href="index.html">Home</a> - The page you're on right now, where I'll most
                    likely have my most recent project posted.</li>
<li><a href="resume.html">Résumé</a> - Features my résumé, summarizing my
                    professional exploits</li>
<li><a href="about.html">About</a> - A page where you can learn more about me, be it
                    links to my socials, or whatever TV show or game I'm experiencing right
                    now.</li>
<li><a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> - A showcase of various art I've created over
 the years</li>
<li><a href="projects.html">Projects</a> - A breakdown of a lot of the work I've done in
                    my career.</li>

## Ace Attorney Project
In Spring 2024, I worked with some peers to catalogue and analyze all the text data
from the Ace Attorney franchise, using data analysis methods we learned in class!<br />

## WE HAVE A PROBLEM
In Fall 2022, I worked with a group of classmates to create a text-based sci-fi
horror game. I was the coder! <a

Alternatively, <a

download the game yourself</a> and play it offline:

To install and run this game, download the zip file WEHAVEAPROBLEM.zip, uncompress
it to the location of your choice, then open the file and choose either game.html,
game NO FLICKER.html to play without the flickering effect, or game NO CRT.html to
play without the CRT effect entirely.
